As I did this project I had forgotten your requirements of matching column names. 
Consequently there are 5 columns, completed and duedate are the additional two.
I did go back and try to rename everything to the three columns required and the database to pull.
I added screenshots to show the project does work on my end. I recreated the table and walked through the actions.
I've also uploaded a test database if needed if there are column call errors.

Future adds:
With javascript adding an anchor to jump to the updateCard would be required for use-ability.
A show completed checkbox of some sorts, hence the completed table column.
